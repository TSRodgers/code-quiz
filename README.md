# code-quiz

## This project is a code-quiz app, upon load you can click view highscores, which will bring you to the highscores page, which will load recent scores (i was unable to figure out how to sort the scores in descending order), and give you the option to clear score (which will clear localStorage) or play again, which will bring you back to the home page. Upon clicking the start quiz button, a timer will start and you will be presented a series of questions (only 6) which are in a random order, upon correct answer choice, you will move on the the next question, and be told you were correct, upon incorrect answer choice, you will have 10 seconds subtracted from the time, move on to the next question and be told you were incorrect. When you answer all 6 questions you will be shown you score (time remainging) and be prompted to enter you initials. When initals are entered and submit button is clicked you will be brought to the highscore page and you will see your score.
